# Hello World First Lab Page Hello!

I'm a geography student at UF being introduced to Github codespaces and pages. I'm saying hello to the world for this project since it's the beginning of my coding journey in GIS4102C where we visit web development basics!

## Project Description

In this lab I created my first Github repository!

## Files in the Repository 

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the "Hello World" webpage. It contains the structure and content of the webpage. 
- `README.md`: This file, providing details about the project and the learning process. 

## View the Webpage You can view the webpage I created at `https://<my-username>.github.io/helloworld/`.

## Questions or Issues If you have any questions about my project or encounter any issues, please open an issue in this repository, and I'll look into it as soon as possible. 

Thank you for checking out my first GitHub project!
